### Question 1

## First Place
# I think that this poster has a lot of interesting and helpful visualizations,
# however the visualizations with the blocks of color do look somewhat confusing
# at first glance and there isn't a lot of text on the poster to describe a lot about
# the different visualizations.

## Second Place
# I think that this poster has a good text to visualization ratio and visualizations
# that don't look too confusing at first glance.

## Third Place
# I think that this poster has a good text to visualization ratio, however a lot
# of the visualizations look the same and some variety or more interesting 
# visualizations might make this poster stand out more.

## Honorable Mention
# I think this poster might have a little bit too much text and there are also 
# a lot of math equations that could confuse the readers, however I enjoy the 
# visualizations that they use.

## Other poster number 1
# I think that this poster has was too much text and not enough visualizations 
# as there is only one, and it doesn't seem important for the poster to include
# the code snippets that were used.

## Other poster number 2
# I think that this poster has too much text for the amount of visualizations
# that there are, the visualizations seem pretty informative though.

## Other poster number 3
# I think that this poster does a good job of visualizing the data over time, but
# the visualizations could maybe be a little more intersting.

## Other poster number 4
# I think that this poster has too much text for the amount of visualizations that
# there are, also more advanced visualizations and better colors could be used.

### Question 2

## Book 1
# One thing I learned is when you have two curves on one graph sometimes it is
# helpful to make another graph that has a curve which is the difference between
# the two curves on the original graph. This is helpful to see trends in the data
# because some common graphs do not communicate numerical information effectively.
# Another thing I learned is that color coding data points, lines, etc. or using
# different color saturations or densities can help a viewer distinguish the different
# groups that the data is trying to show better.

## Book 2
# One thing I learned is that 0 doesn't always need to be included in the scale,
# sometimes including it makes the data harder to read and represents it in a 
# smaller frame than we would necessarily like.
# Another thing I learned is that there are some challenges to graphical display.
# One has to make sure that they are using the correct equation when describing
# the pattern/relationship of the data. Also, a visualization can be greatly 
# improved if one plots the data on a log scale. Lastly, one has to make sure
# that all of their labels are correct.

### Question 3

# import pandas as pd
# import glob
# 
# path = r'/class/datamine/data/flights/subset/'
# all_files = glob.glob(path + "*.csv")
# 
# df = (pd.read_csv(file) for file in all_files)
# 
# flights_df = pd.concat(df, ignore_index = True)

### Question 4

## First Place
# After exploring data visualization I still think this poster has a lot of
# interesting and helpful visualizations, however the visualizations with the
# blocks of color do still seem like they'd be a little confusing 
# at first glance. Otherwise the others use good colors and types of graphs and 
# seem to display the information that is wanted to be displayed.

## Second Place
# I think that this poster has decent graphs that aren't too confusing, use
# colors when warranted to show many different things, are are correctly used.

## Third Place
# I think that some of the graphs on this poster are a little confusing because
# there aren't specific colors for each line on the line graphs. There are only 
# colors for 3 different airlines and then the rest are gray. This makes things 
# kind of hard to decipher even if those other airlines aren't important.

## Honorable Mention
# I think it would be helpful if some of these graphs used different shapes or 
# different colors to show the findings as sometimes different sizes of the same 
# shape are hard to tell apart and colors that are too similar are hard to tell
# apart.

## Other poster number 1
# There is only one graph on this poster and it is very simple. Maybe differences
# between the lines or other things could be plotted to see trends in the data.
# Only having one graph isn't show much and isn't necessarily showing what 
# needs to be shown.

## Other poster number 2
# I think that these graphs are all colored well when need be and show what needs
# to be shown. However, some of the graphs are really busy and almost have too 
# much going on which makes it hard to figure out everything the graph is trying
# to show.

## Other poster number 3
# Some of the colors on some of these graphs are hard to tell apart, but on 
# others it's not. They do a good job of shading and showing saturation/densities
# on some of the graphs though.

## Other poster number 4
# The graphs on this poster are really basic, and the ones that aren't are too
# hard to read as their axes aren't allowing the data to be shown well and they're
# just also really small.

# I think that my impression changed the most for the honorable mention poster.
# This is because before I was more focused on the visualizations looking interesting.
# However, after looking deeper into the graphs some of them were really busy and 
# the use of different sizes of one shape or different colors
# that were somewhat similar looking to one another to show the data seemed a little
# confusing and made the graphs harder to read. I feel like it could be improved upon.
